			<h1>Forlorn Four <small>Instructions (hastily written at 12:30 AM)</small></h1>
			
			<p>Your goal is to find the valuable artifact (symbolized by a '*') on the 10th level of the dungeon.</p>

			<p>You create a party of four adventurers, selected from seven classes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>fighter</strong> is an all-around competent
				adventurer.</li>
				<li>The <strong>berserker</strong> attacks well, but is damaged
				more easily.</li>
				<li>The <strong>stalwart</strong> is a good defender, but has a
				weak attack.</li>
				<li>The <strong>rogue</strong> is weaker than the figher, but
				may not be noticed by monsters.</li>
				<li>The <strong>assassin</strong> has a very strong attack and
				also may sneak past monsters, but is very weak defending.</li>
				<li>The <strong>mage</strong> has a strong magic blast, but is
				weak physically.</li>
				<li>The <strong>cleric</strong> can heal allies, but is also
				weak physically.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="lead">Controls:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>numpad or hjklyubn</strong> &mdash; move (or attack, if the square is occupied by a monster)</li>
				<li><strong>&gt; and &lt;</strong> &mdash; descend or ascend stairs (represented by &gt; and &lt; symbols)</li>
				<li><strong>.</strong> &mdash; end turn early</strong></li>
				<li><strong>c</strong> &mdash; cast a spell; move the cursor with the movement keys and hit space to select a square</li>
				<li><strong>d</strong> &mdash; describe a monster; move the cursor with the movement keys and hit space to select a monster</li>
			</ul>
