			<h1>Forlorn Four</h1>
			
			<p class="lead">Your goal is to find the valuable artifact, the Amulet of
			Asterisk, on the 10th level of the dungeon.</p>

			<h4>Classes</h4>

			<p>Your party consists of four adventurers, selected from seven classes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>fighter</strong> is an all-around competent
				dungeon explorer.</li>
				<li>The <strong>berserker</strong> attacks well, but is damaged
				more easily.</li>
				<li>The <strong>stalwart</strong> is an excellent defender, but
				has a weak attack.</li>
				<li>The <strong>rogue</strong> is weaker than the fighter, but
				may not be noticed by monsters.</li>
				<li>The <strong>assassin</strong> has a very strong attack and
				may also sneak past monsters, but is very weak defending.</li>
				<li>The <strong>mage</strong> has a strong magic blast, but is
				weak physically.</li>
				<li>The <strong>cleric</strong> can heal allies, but is also
				weak physically.</li>
			</ul>
